## üìÇ Analyzing Global COVID-19 Trends and Vaccination Progress with a Focus on the UK
*A Public Health Data Analysis Using BigQuery*

## üìñ Introduction

This project explores global COVID-19 trends with a focused lens on the United Kingdom. Using BigQuery's public datasets, the analysis examines confirmed cases, death rates, and vaccination progress from early 2020 to 2023.

The goal is to derive actionable insights from public health data to support decision-making in healthcare, especially for environments like the NHS. The project also compares the UK's vaccination rollout with that of the United States, providing a benchmark for evaluating public health strategies.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- Google BigQuery ‚Äì SQL queries and data processing  
- Looker Studio ‚Äì Dashboard and visualizations  
- GitHub ‚Äì Version control and portfolio showcase  
- Dataset Used: `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`

## üîç Objectives

- Analyze daily and monthly COVID-19 case and death trends in the UK  
- Compare the UK‚Äôs vaccination progress with the US  
- Visualize patterns to understand when major surges or improvements occurred  
- Create a shareable dashboard and GitHub repository for job applications (NHS/data analyst roles)

  AND new_confirmed IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY date;

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly Averages of New Cases and Deaths


SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', date) AS month,
  AVG(new_confirmed) AS avg_cases,
