## ðŸ“‚ Analyzing Global COVID-19 Trends and Vaccination Progress with a Focus on the UK
*A Public Health Data Analysis Using BigQuery*

### ðŸ“Œ Description

This project presents global COVID-19 trends with a focuse on the United Kingdom. Using BigQuery's public datasets. I cleaned and analyzed the datasets to examines confirmed cases, death rates, and vaccination progress from early 2020 to 2023.

###  Objectives

- Analyze daily and monthly COVID-19 case and death trends in the UK  
- Compare the UKâ€™s vaccination progress with Canada 
- Visualize patterns to understand when major surges or improvements occurred  

### ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
- Google BigQuery (SQL)
- Google Spreadsheet/Excel (for charting)
- Public Datasets: `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data`

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses

### 1. UK Daily COVID-19 Cases and Deaths

```sql
SELECT
  date,
  country_name,
  new_confirmed AS daily_cases,
  new_deceased AS daily_deaths
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE
  country_name = 'United Kingdom'
  AND new_confirmed IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY date;
```

### 2. Monthly Averages of New Cases and Deaths in the UK

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', date) AS month,
  AVG(new_confirmed) AS avg_cases,
  AVG(new_deceased) AS avg_deaths
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE
  country_name = 'United Kingdom'
  AND new_confirmed IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

### 3. UK vs Canada Cumulative Vaccination Comparison

```sql
 SELECT
  date,
  MAX(CASE WHEN country_name = 'United Kingdom' THEN cumulative_persons_vaccinated ELSE NULL END) AS uk_vaccinated,
  MAX(CASE WHEN country_name = 'Canada' THEN cumulative_persons_vaccinated ELSE NULL END) AS canada_vaccinated
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE
  country_name IN ('United Kingdom', 'Canada')
  AND cumulative_persons_vaccinated IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

### Dashboard
A visual dashboard was created using Google spreadsheets, displaying:
- Monthly averages
- Comparative vaccination charts

### 1. Monthly COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the UK
- Spikes in early 2021 indicate pandemic waves.
- Deaths follow similar trends but lag behind cases.

### 2. UK vs Canada Vaccination Progress
- UK's rollout was sharper and faster than Canada's.
- Canada started tracking earlier but grew slower initially.
- Vaccination helped reduce deaths significantly in the UK by late 2021

## Conclusion
Vaccinations helped flatten the curve in the UK, as seen in the decline in both cases and deaths after mass vaccination began.

The UKâ€™s faster rollout may have contributed to earlier control over virus spread compared to Canada.

This analysis shows the value of cloud-based public health analysis using BigQuery and SQL. Due to data availability limitations for the United States in the BigQuery dataset, Canada was selected as an alternative for comparison.
